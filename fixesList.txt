This is the list of fixes needed for the HIP port to compile.

After compile_01.log:
    File: FunctionsCuda.cpp
    The following properties are not used when compiled with HIP: 
        g.overlap=deviceProp.deviceOverlap;
        g.overlapcount=deviceProp.asyncEngineCount;
        g.uva=deviceProp.unifiedAddressing

After compile_02.log:
    File: JDsPips_ker.cu
    The following inclusion is not used when compiled with HIP:
        #include <math_constants.h>
        (No additional constants needed to be defined manually)

After compile_03.log:
    File: JDsGauge_ker.cu
    The following inclusion is not used when compiled with HIP:
        #include <math_constants.h>
        (No additional constants needed to be defined manually)

After compile_04.log:
    File: JSphGpu_ker.cu
    The following inclusion is not used when compiled with HIP:
        #include <math_constants.h>
        (No additional constants needed to be defined manually)

After compile_05.log:
    File: JSphGpu_InOut_iker.cu
    The following inclusion is not used when compiled with HIP:
        #include <math_constants.h>
        (No additional constants needed to be defined manually)

After compile_06.log: FIRST SUCCESS! Code is running
    DamBreak example ran, using script: xCaseDambreak_AMD_linux64_GPU_CrayCluster.sh
        which makes use of the binary: dualsphysicsgpu="${dirbin}/AmdGpu/DualSPHysics5.2Amd_linux64_CrayCluster"

----------------------
From here, modifications are to improve code to better performance

Improvement 1:
    File: JSphGpu_ker.cu
        Fixed function: Interaction_ForcesT_KerInfo, to provide kernel information with HIP.
         Before the code was hidden inside an if CUDART_VERSION >=something.
    File: FunctionsCuda.cpp
        Fixed function: GetCudaDevicesInfo, to retrieve the properties that are inside
         ifs CUDART_VERSION >= something.
    Compilation log: compile_07.log
